##### By: Sayre (Travis Rose)

   

## Project Description:
This React application allows users to complete an application for a software developing position and review their submissions for completeness. The project features form field components that can be extracted independently and used as starting templates for additional projects and demonstrates how to incorporate a redux store to track user inputs within a form. 

## Top Features List:
1. All basic field types displayed (Text, Select, Multiselect, Radio, Textarea)
2. Utilizes React, Redux, Webpack, Jest, & Flow as main support Libraries
3. Simple Responsize UI 


## Future Features:
While the application is fully functioning, there are areas that still need attention to make it the best it can be. Planned updates are currently targeting the following areas:

- Resolve current Flow errors being returned
- Complete additional testing (primarily integration)
- Incorporate additional error validation throughout the project
